# What is a computer
At it's most basic, a computer is any machine that can take some data as input, run some predefined operations on it, and produce some output.

Surely something as complex as a phone, laptop, or tablet are more involved than that! But at their core, they are not. Every computer built by humans, follows the same pattern of input > operation > output.

What a computer does is not the important "bit". Long before there have been machine computers, there have been human computers; those folks who looked at stock and write the totals down, for instance. What makes machine computers so magical is the speed at which they can process data. 

The shear speed at which a machine computer works enables complex operations to be ran as a large number of simple operations.

## The language of computers
Electronic computers have an extremely limiting factor when it comes to how they accept and operate on data; they can only understand 2 values. These two values have many names, on/off, true/false, 0/1, but in the physical world they are 0 Volts and _n_ Volts, where _n_ is usually 3.3 to 12 Volts. No matter how complex the computer, at it's physical core, it will be restricted by this physical limitation.

Thankfully, Humans are smart. We figured out how to work with a _Base 2_ number system; we call it Binary.
