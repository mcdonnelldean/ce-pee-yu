# Cee Pee Yu

Cee Pee Yu is a Modular PCB based 8-Bit CPU Study. It follows Ben Eater's, [Build an 8-Bit Computer][], reference design as it's basis.

The primary differentiation is the fact that Cee Pee Yu is not built on a series of bread boards, rather, it is composed of a number of custom designed PCB boards. Besides this, there are minor additions and changes to make the project more compatible with PCB Format.
