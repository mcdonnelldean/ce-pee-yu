# cee-pee-yu
CeePeeYu Is a Modular PCB based 8-Bit CPU study. It follows Ben Eater's "Build and 8-Bit Computer" reference design as it's basis. The primary difference is the fact that CeePeeYu is not built on a series of bread boards, rather, it is composed of a number of custom designed PCB boards.

## Who is this for
As a study, this resource is primarily for the benefit of me. However, the point of this study is to clearly and deeply work through the process of building a CPU; and in that regard, it should be easy to follow for anyone with sufficent interest.

However, because CeePeeYu is a living study, it is likely to be wrong, incomplete, and missing key info in a number of places. I want to explicitly call this out at the outset because my time available to work on CeePeeYu will be bursty.

## What is the end goal
The ideal end state for CeePeeYu, is a modular set of 'parts' that can be put together to form different sorts of simple CPU's. In terms of complexity the hope is to eventually be able to run very simple C code (likely enough to compute the fibonacci sequence).
