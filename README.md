# Cee Pee Yu

Cee Pee Yu Is a Modular PCB based 8-Bit CPU study. It follows Ben Eater's "Build and 8-Bit Computer" reference design as it's basis. The primary difference is the fact that Cee Pee Yu is not built on a series of bread boards, rather, it is composed of a number of custom designed PCB boards.
