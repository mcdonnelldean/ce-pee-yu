# Electronics 101
Put simply, electronics is the ability to build electrical circuits, which in turn enable electric machinery (in our case, a computer). 

These circuits and machines are powered using energy harvested from of the very universe itself, we call this electricity.

## Electricity
Electricity is not itself a force. The force is called electromagnetism. Electromagnetism exists everywhere and within everything in the universe. It can be used to move quantities of energy about the place. Generally the electromagnetic force is balanced and the result is you don't feel it. But if we jiggle it a little, it can be felt.

The whole point of electronics, at it's simplest, is to design circuits that can transfer energy to one or a collection of components. These components or groups of components, take this energy, in the form of electricity, and convert it into something else, light, sound, or even pulsing signals that contain encoded information.
