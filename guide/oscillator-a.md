# Oscillator A
At the heart of every computer lies a clock. At the heart of every clock lies an Oscillator. A clocks timing signal is produced by an oscillator, which is a fancy word something that vibrates, or swings back and forth. The speed, or frequency, of clock is the number of times it's oscillator swings back and forth per second. It is measured in Hertz. Before we look at building an Oscillator, we need to talk about why it, or more correctly the signal of pulses it produces, is important.

We know from [What is a computer](), the heart of a computer, it's CPU, is a collection of modules that work together to process a set of operations on data. For this collection of modules to work together, they need some sort of signal that lets them know when to start an operation, when to stop, and when to read and write data to other modules.

All of this can be achieved with a very simple signal of pulses, like below

```
